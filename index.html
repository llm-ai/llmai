Deep learning techniques have advanced rapidly in recent years, leading to significant progress in pre-trained and fine-tuned large-scale AI models. For example, in the natural language processing domain, the traditional "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm is shifting towards the "pre-train, prompt, and predict" paradigm, which has achieved great success on many tasks across different application domains such as ChatGPT/BARD for Conversational AI and P5 for a unified recommendation system. Moreover, there has been a growing interest in models that combine vision and language modalities (vision-language models) which are applied to tasks like Visual Captioning/Generation.		   
		    </p>    
                    <p class="lead" >
Considering the recent technological revolution, it is essential to have a workshop at the KDD conference that emphasizes these paradigm shifts and highlights the paradigms with the potential to solve different tasks. This workshop will provide a platform for academic and industrial researchers to showcase their latest work, share research ideas, discuss various challenges, and identify areas where further research is needed in pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompt-learning methods for large-scale AI models. The workshop will also foster the development of a strong research community focused on solving challenges related to large-scale AI models, providing superior and impactful strategies that can change people’s lives in the future.

			              Fundamental improvements in recommendation and ranking have been much harder to come by, when compared with recent progress on other long-standing AI problems such as visual/audio machine perception and machine translation. 
						Some reasons include: (1) large amounts of data making training difficult, yet having (2) noisy and sparse labels; (3) changing dynamics of context such as user preferences and items; and (4) low-latency requirement for a system response. Moreover, one new challenge is devising approaches to (5) learning more inclusive and robust models.

<br>
<br>
In this talk, Ed will touch upon many recent advances in neural modeling techniques for recommendations and their impact in Google products covering ~600 improvements over the last 5 years across these problems, including:

<ul>
  <li> (a). Multi-task models with gated mixture of experts and utilizing TPUs for large sparse models</li>
  <li> (b). Large output item spaces with Neural Deep Retrieval</li>
  <li> (c). Policy gradient RL techniques with off-policy correction in recommendation models</li>
	<li> (d). Diversification and slate optimization</li>
	<li> (e). Adversarial approaches for inclusiveness and robustness for Classifiers and Recommenders</li>
</ul>

					With the growing capabilities in how we represent and process structured and unstructured text, there are many opportunities to innovate newer and deeper search paradigms. This would allow us to go beyond building one-off models, each focusing on a specific question-answering (QA) task targeting a specific domain, reasoning skill, or answer type. In this talk, Caiming will start with a series of in-depth presentations on a few of the recent QA research conducted by the Salesforce AI Research team addressing several key questions in the QA domain.

We posit that the objective of recommendation of such complex information items shall go beyond high accuracy of satisfying user personal interests to high social responsibility.   Socially responsible recommender systems  call for shift to a new paradigm of data preparation, recommendation model and evaluation.

					Recent work in e-commerce product search and recommendations have shown result improvement by using large scale pre-trained model based Deep Learning approach. However, this has not been an easy task in the real-world development and deployment due to several constraints: 1) scaling the size of model and training data with computational efficiency is challenging; 2) boosting the incumbent ML applications performance using large scale pre-trained model in the real business setting requires careful algorithm design and data strategy; and 3) serving millions of requests per second at high throughput and low latency is a daunting task. In this talk, I will share our recent work that addresses these issues and a vision for future innovations.
