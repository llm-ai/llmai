In recent years, the AI community has witnessed an exciting acceleration in innovation across foundation models, deep learning, new AI applications across numerous verticals, and more.  In addition, AI innovations driven by both academic and industry research labs have rapidly been adopted by big tech companies and startups to deliver value-differentiated products and services.			</p>    
                    <p class="lead">
                      For many machine learning researchers looking at commercializing their work, one of the frequently wondered  questions is - “How do I kickstart a startup that can commercialize my research innovations?”.  For many ML practitioners in the KDD community, there is always curiosity on how big tech and startups take AI research and innovations, and scale it to be used by millions of users. 
		    </p>    
                    <p class="lead" >
		    This interactive workshop aims to achieve two goals:  First, the workshop will bring together invited \textbf{AI thought leaders} working in academia, big tech as well as startups to share their perspective on the next big AI ideas that will change the world, and deliver impact. Second, the workshop will invite \textbf{startup founders} (from both academia and industry) to share their journey of acquiring customers, building a team, pitching for initial funding, and commercializing their research into successful enterprises.

			              Fundamental improvements in recommendation and ranking have been much harder to come by, when compared with recent progress on other long-standing AI problems such as visual/audio machine perception and machine translation. 
						Some reasons include: (1) large amounts of data making training difficult, yet having (2) noisy and sparse labels; (3) changing dynamics of context such as user preferences and items; and (4) low-latency requirement for a system response. Moreover, one new challenge is devising approaches to (5) learning more inclusive and robust models.

<br>
<br>
In this talk, Ed will touch upon many recent advances in neural modeling techniques for recommendations and their impact in Google products covering ~600 improvements over the last 5 years across these problems, including:

<ul>
  <li> (a). Multi-task models with gated mixture of experts and utilizing TPUs for large sparse models</li>
  <li> (b). Large output item spaces with Neural Deep Retrieval</li>
  <li> (c). Policy gradient RL techniques with off-policy correction in recommendation models</li>
	<li> (d). Diversification and slate optimization</li>
	<li> (e). Adversarial approaches for inclusiveness and robustness for Classifiers and Recommenders</li>
</ul>

					With the growing capabilities in how we represent and process structured and unstructured text, there are many opportunities to innovate newer and deeper search paradigms. This would allow us to go beyond building one-off models, each focusing on a specific question-answering (QA) task targeting a specific domain, reasoning skill, or answer type. In this talk, Caiming will start with a series of in-depth presentations on a few of the recent QA research conducted by the Salesforce AI Research team addressing several key questions in the QA domain.

We posit that the objective of recommendation of such complex information items shall go beyond high accuracy of satisfying user personal interests to high social responsibility.   Socially responsible recommender systems  call for shift to a new paradigm of data preparation, recommendation model and evaluation.  In this talk, I will discuss our recent work on recommendation of social media items for the mitigation of misinformation and fairness of information sources, as well as user trust of information items. </h5>

					Recent work in e-commerce product search and recommendations have shown result improvement by using large scale pre-trained model based Deep Learning approach. However, this has not been an easy task in the real-world development and deployment due to several constraints: 1) scaling the size of model and training data with computational efficiency is challenging; 2) boosting the incumbent ML applications performance using large scale pre-trained model in the real business setting requires careful algorithm design and data strategy; and 3) serving millions of requests per second at high throughput and low latency is a daunting task. In this talk, I will share our recent work that addresses these issues and a vision for future innovations.
